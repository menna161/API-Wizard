# API Wizard IDE Plugin
This repositry includes our source code work for our thesis project at The American University in Cairo 
Supervised by Dr.Sarah Nadi (nadi@ualberta.ca) and Dr.Ahmead Rafea (rafea@aucegypt.edu)

# Overview
API Wizard is a VSCode IDE plugin based on pattern mining that allows users to view a common usage example of a certain Python API they would like to use.
Using this plugin, you can easily use a keyboard shortcut over the API query to invoke the IDE plugin which views the usage example of this API.
This project reimplements the algorithm of the state-of-the-art tool Exempla Gratis with some modifications to overcome the limitations discussed in our paper.
API Wizard uses gSpan as its mining frequent subgraphs algorithm.


# Getting Started
